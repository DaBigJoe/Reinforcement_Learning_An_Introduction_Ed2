# Reinforcement_Learning_An_Introduction_Ed2_Solutions
My solutions to the exercises in the second edition (2018) of Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto.
This is an on-going project to complete all the exercises for each chapter of the book, and also reimplement examples where useful.
While the book is not yet published, a near-final draft is available online [here](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html).

## Format
The main write-up is in Latex, with programming solutions done in Python. The work is grouped by chapter, with the master document [solutions.tex](solutions.tex) in the root directory. A complied version of the Latex document is also included for ease of use, see [solutions.pdf](solutions.pdf).
